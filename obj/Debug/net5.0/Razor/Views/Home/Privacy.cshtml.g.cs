    <h2>What is Privacy?</h2>
    A privacy policy is a statement or legal document (in privacy law) that discloses some or all of the 
    ways a party gathers, uses, discloses, and manages a customer or client's data. 
    Personal information can be anything that can be used to identify an individual, not limited to the person's name, 
    address, date of birth, marital status, contact information, ID issue, and expiry date, financial records, credit information, 
    medical history, where one travels, and intentions to acquire goods and services.[2] In the case of a business, it is often a 
    statement that declares a party's policy on how it collects, stores, and releases personal information it collects. It informs 
    the client what specific information is collected, and whether it is kept confidential, shared with partners, or sold to other 
    firms or enterprises.
    Privacy ");
            WriteLiteral(@"policies typically represent a broader, more generalized treatment, as opposed to data use statements, 
    which tend to be more detailed and specific.
    The exact contents of a certain privacy policy will depend upon the applicable law and may need to address requirements across 
    geographical boundaries and legal jurisdictions. Most countries have their own legislation and guidelines of who is covered, 
    what information can be collected, and what it can be used for. In general, data protection laws in Europe cover the private 
    sector, as well as the public sector. Their privacy laws apply not only to government operations but also to private enterprises 
    and commercial transactions.
    California Business and Professions Code, Internet Privacy Requirements (CalOPPA) mandate that websites collecting Personally 
    Identifiable Information (PII) from California residents must conspicuously post their privacy policy.
